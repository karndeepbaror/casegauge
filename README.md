***🛡️ Case Gauge : Investigative Decision Support System (IDSS)***

`Case Gauge Titan` is a `web-based Investigative Decision Support System (IDSS)` designed to evaluate the forensic strength, integrity, and investigation readiness of `online cyber fraud cases.`

Unlike traditional scam checkers or complaint forms, `Case Gauge Titan` focuses on post-incident forensic preparedness, helping users understand whether a case is **traceable, evidentially sound, and legally presentable before approaching `law enforcement.`
