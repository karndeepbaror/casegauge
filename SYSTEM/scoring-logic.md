## Forensic Scoring Logic

**The Confidence Score (0–100) is calculated using:**

- Evidence traceability
- Time delay impact
- Integrity preservation
- Victim actions

**Penalties apply for:**
- Phone reset
- Edited or altered evidence
- Delayed reporting

This mirrors real-world cyber `investigation constraints.`
